    title: "Aesthetic Language: The Interplay Between Language, Art, and the Sensible",
    subtitle: "Master's Thesis in Philosophy",
    university: "Université Paris 8, Vincennes-Saint-Denis",
    program: "Master 1 Philosophy: Analysis and Criticism of Art and Culture",
    period: "September 2021 - June 2025",
    grade: "18/20",
    average: "15.2",
    supervisor: "Dr. Gerhard Schmezer",
    abstract: "This thesis develops an original theoretical framework for understanding aesthetic language as a distinct mode of communication that operates beyond the boundaries of discursive expression. Drawing on continental philosophy, particularly the works of Wittgenstein, Dewey, Deleuze, and Merleau-Ponty, the research investigates how aesthetic experiences generate meaning through embodied, sensorial, and non-linguistic pathways. The work establishes foundational concepts for human-AI aesthetic interaction protocols, demonstrating how philosophical theory can inform practical applications in contemporary technology design.",
