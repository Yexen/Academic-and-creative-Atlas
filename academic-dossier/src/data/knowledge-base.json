      "mainTheme": "Exploration into how language can transcend conventional logical and discursive limitations to access and express the 'realm of the sensible'",
      "aestheticDefinition": "Not language dealing with beauty, but language that belongs to and interacts with sensibility - 'the investigation of that which belongs to the realm of sensibility' contrasting with conceptual domain of logic",
      "coreQuestion": "How can language, a logical structure, interact with the sensible?",
      "aestheticLanguageDefinition": "A kind of language that goes beyond its logical limitations, a kind of language that shows instead of saying",
      "wittgensteinFoundation": "Starting from Wittgenstein's assertion: 'There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical' (Tractus 6.522)",
      "mysticalConcept": "In early Wittgenstein, mystical referred to what cannot be said, what lies beyond limitation of language, what shows itself - aspect of reality that eludes language's capacity to describe because language is constructed around logical structure",
      "laterWittgenstein": "While term 'mystical' disappears from later work, concept of ineffable persists, referring to that which we accept as part of our form of life and background against which we understand world",
      "deleuzeConnection": "Uses Deleuze's term 'sensible' to describe parts of reality that are immediately experienced or perceived, combining Deleuze's sensible with Wittgenstein's mystical to enrich understanding of language shaping human experience",
      "languageArtInterplay": "Encourages viewing language as form of art and art as form of language - despite being distinct concepts, they have numerous similarities and interconnectedness allowing them to function interchangeably",
      "philosophicalSynthesis": "Uniquely combines perspectives of three influential 20th-century philosophers from distinct traditions: Wittgenstein (analytic), Deleuze (continental), and Dewey (pragmatic)"
    },
    "coreQuestions": [
      "How does language transcend logical limitations to engage with the realm of the sensible?",
      "What constitutes 'aesthetic language' as expression that shows rather than says?",

    "theoreticalFramework": {
      "aestheticLanguage": "Language as creative force engaging with sensibility and expressing ineffable aspects of human experience, operating between representation and reality",

        "antiEssentialism": "All three philosophers consistently argue against different aspects of essentialism",
        "wittgensteinAntiEssential": "Argues against idea of fixed, essential meaning for words or concepts, highlighting fluidity and dependence on context and use: 'The meaning of a word is its use in language' (§43)",
        "deweyAntiEssential": "Argued against fixed, static conceptions of reality, knowledge, and human nature, emphasizing importance of context, process, and change",
        "deleuzeAntiEssential": "Philosophy characterized by rejection of essentialism and focus on becoming, difference and multiplicity: 'The concept is not a representation that reflects a pre-existing object... It is a process of differentiation' (1994, p.171)",
        "fluidMeaning": "Direct consequence of anti-essentialism - words do not have fixed, pre-determined meanings. Language is fluid and meaning is contextual",
        "activeLanguage": "Language is not merely passive representation of reality but creative and productive force that generates meaning rather than merely transmits it"
      },
      "individualContributions": {
        "deleuzeContribution": "Emphasizes language and art as active forces that contribute to creation and transformation of reality, blurring boundaries between logical and aesthetic. Framework suggests exploration of how language can engage with sensibility, evoking and communicating sensory experiences beyond traditional linguistic boundaries",
        "deweyContribution": "Highlights integration of aesthetic experiences into everyday life, stressing contextual significance of encounters, acknowledging role of social interaction in shaping meaning. Views aesthetic encounters as integral to daily activities, expanding scope of aesthetic language beyond traditional art forms. 'Language is social product; it is not mere instrument for communication of ready-made ideas, but means for creating them' (1916, Ch.8)",
        "wittgensteinContribution": "Concepts of language games and mystical highlight ways language can show rather than say, illuminating expressive power beyond logical structure. Emphasizes practical use of language and context-dependent nature of meaning, enabling articulation of unsayable aspects of human experience"

      "spatialPhilosophy": "Inspired by work with Sepand Danesh - understanding how spatial forms (cubes, corners, voxels) create meaning through compositional context",
      "temporalEcologies": "Three temporal modes: reading (immediate present), translation (sequential historical interpretation), writing (infinite temporal projection)",
      "aiAestheticEngagement": "Framework for enhanced human-AI interaction through sustained aesthetic engagement protocols rather than purely functional exchange",
      "examplesImportance": "Examples essential for understanding aesthetic language from each philosophical view - provide light on subtle links between language, experience, and expression.
